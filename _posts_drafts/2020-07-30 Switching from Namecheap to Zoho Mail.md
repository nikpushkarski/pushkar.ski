# Switching from Namecheap to Zoho Mail

## My usage setup

I've been using Gmail for about... 10 years or so. Since I set up an email with Namecheap, all the incoming letters are being forwarded to my \*****@gmail account. It did for some time, until I realized that I see not a 100% of incoming letters in my Gmail account.

## Why switching?

SPAM folder consumes too much of credible content.

I.e., the Spotify greeting/verification email. It's a shame. 

## Zoho or G Suite?

That was my matter of choice. The first thought was to upgrade my good old gmail account to a paid one. Or, to register a new, separate G Suite account and then merge it with the old Gmail account.

Pity, but it's not possible to upgrade a regular Gmail account to a G Suite one (TODO paste the link here).  

Ok then. I'd looked a bunch of "The best 5/7/10 email hosting providers" reviews and Zoho was everywhere. In addition, its pricing is comparable with a cheap Namcheap (a little pun here, but it's a fact anyway), so I decided to give it a try.

## Namecheap Backup

Even though I decided to leave this provider, I cannot deny a fact that they have a comprehensive documentation. That said, I didn't have any issues while backing up my emails, I just followed [this guide](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9454/2226/how-to-back-up-and-restore-emails-in-private-email-webmail/) to save all the incoming messages as one file. Outbound messages weren't stored on Namecheap's side as I've been using Gmail for sending letters, hence, there was no need neither possibility to retrieve sent letters from Namecheap's web client :) 

## Zoho Setup 

At first, I stumbled upon a little bug on their side: during registration, I specified my contact email (a Gmail one), but  into an error, "The given email address already exist". Well, that was a reminder that I already has an account there, I totally forgot about it. So I tried to restore my password using this Gmail address, but no luck â€” I didn't receive a letter for password reset. As a result, I couldn't register, couldn't restore access.

Few hours later a reset letter arrived, but the link in there was already expired. I request another letter and got it immediately this time, successfully changes the password, logged in to my Zoho account, and started to set up Zoho mail.

Have to mention that Zoho's docs are great too, but they provided me with an advanced UX in comparison with Namecheap: besides an onboarding email with all the steps required, they implemented an straightforward, step-by-step interface to ensure that a user wouldn't skip any required actions. As a more or less advanced user (or, better say, knowing-exactly-what-he-wants user) I first specified TXT and MX records, i.e., I performed steps 1 and 3. I didn't add user and/or organizations, though.

All this time I'd been on a free plan, which is important to emphasize: it appeared that Zoho mail is **fully** operational without any charges. They gave me access to a web client and mobile apps as well. However, my next step was subscription for the Lite plan which allowed me to enable IMAP access. I used this feature to gain access to my letters via Gmail on Android.

## Spotify: a Litmus Test

During my onboarding, I received a letter from Spotify welcoming me to create my first playlist. The fact is, this letter came directly to my **Inbox**, not to the **Spam** folder; that already can be called a success! Anyway, I came with an idea to recreate the original case mentioned in the beginning of this article, so I deleted my Spotify account in order to create a new one with the same email, but... Such a case requires to wait 14 days :) So I wasn't able to do that immediately. Anyway, during the closing procedure Spotify sent me a bunch of emails and all of them had been arriving immediately to a web client. Into **Inbox**, of course.

## To Be Continued

Zoho Mail seems to operate just fine, but I bear in mind that Namecheap did the same at the very beginning :) So, only time will tell if it's a worthy provider or not.

What I can say for sure is that:

* Zoho web client IS NOT comparable with Namecheap's one: it works super fast, it has an appealing UI/UX and, in my humble opinion, can beat a Gmail web client by all measures. 
* Also, I remember how recently I applied wrong DNS settings that broke sending/receiving processes; after I fixed the parameters, it took about a 24 hours for Namecheap to get back to normal functioning. Setting up a brand new TXT/MX records for Zoho Mail meant the same, so I expected more or less same time. Suprisingly, the new email provider started on its full in about 5-6 hours after initial setup, which is awesome.
