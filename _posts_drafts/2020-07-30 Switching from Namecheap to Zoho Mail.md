# Switching from Namecheap to Zoho Mail

## My usage setup

I've been using Gmail for about... 10 years or so. Since I set up an email with Namecheap, all the incoming letters are being forwarded to my \*****@gmail account. It did for some time, until I realized that I see not a 100% of incoming letters in my Gmail account.

## Why switching?

SPAM folder consumes too much of credible content.

I.e., the Spotify greeting/verification email. It's a shame. 

## Zoho or G Suite?

That was my matter of choice. The first thought was to upgrade my good old gmail account to a paid one. Or, to register a new, separate G Suite account and then merge it with the old Gmail account.

Pity, but it's not possible to upgrade a regular Gmail account to a G Suite one (TODO paste the link here).  

Ok then. I'd looked a bunch of "The best 5/7/10 email hosting providers" reviews and Zoho was everywhere. In addition, its pricing is comparable with a cheap Namcheap (a little pun here, but it's a fact anyway), so I decided to give it a try.

## Namecheap Backup

## Zoho Setup

## Spotify: a Litmus Test

## To Be Continued

Zoho seems to operate just fine, but I bear in mind that Namecheap did the same at the very beginning :) So, only time will tell if it's a worthy provider or not.
